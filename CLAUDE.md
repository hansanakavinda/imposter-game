# CLAUDE.md

Party Arcade — a mobile-first React SPA hosting three party games: **Imposter**
(pass-and-play), **UNO** (solo-vs-AI and P2P multiplayer), and **Tank Arena**
(real-time P2P). Everything runs in the browser; multiplayer is peer-to-peer over
WebRTC with no game server.

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev          # Vite dev server, host: true so phones on the same Wi-Fi can connect
npm run build        # production build
npm run lint         # oxlint  (NOT eslint — see below)
npm test             # vitest, single run
npm run test:watch   # vitest, watch mode
```

To test multiplayer you need two devices: `npm run dev`, then open
`http://<your-lan-ip>:5173` on a phone on the same network.

## Stack

React 19 · Vite 8 · Tailwind CSS v4 · PeerJS · oxlint · Vitest · deployed on Vercel.

Tailwind v4 is configured **CSS-first** in `src/index.css` via `@tailwindcss/vite`.
There is no `tailwind.config.js` — do not create one.

Linting is **oxlint**, not ESLint. `eslint-disable` comments are honoured, but there is
no ESLint config and no `eslint` dependency. Rules live in `.oxlintrc.json`.

**Do not disable `no-undef`.** `vite build` happily compiles a reference to an
identifier that resolves to nothing — it only fails at runtime, in the browser, on the
screen that uses it. `no-undef` is the only check in the toolchain that catches it, and
it caught two such crashes during the last refactor. `env` is set to browser + node so
DOM and `process` globals resolve.

## Layout

```
src/
  App.jsx                 state-based router (no react-router); ?game= / ?room= deep links
  components/             hub UI (Navbar, GameHub). Nothing game-specific.
  components/ui/          the design system: Button, Modal, Screen, Pill, inputs, roster
  services/               cross-game infrastructure (peerConfig.js: ICE/TURN + room codes + share links)
  hooks/                  HUB-ONLY shared React hooks (useCopyFeedback)
  utils/sound.js          Web Audio synth shared by all three games
  data/games.js           hub card metadata
  games/<game>/
    <Game>.jsx            composition + screen routing only
    components/           that game's UI
    engine/               PURE game logic, no React, no side effects — this is what tests target
    hooks/                stateful React glue between engine and UI
    services/             that game's networking
    utils/ constants/ data/
api/turn.js               Vercel serverless: hands out TURN credentials
```

Rules of thumb:

- A game's code lives under `src/games/<game>/`. If it is only used by one game, it does
  not belong in `src/components/`, `src/data/` or `src/utils/`.
- `components/ui/` is the exception, and the only one: it holds cross-game *presentation*
  primitives that know nothing about any game. Per-game colour reaches them as a `tone`
  prop (`imposter` / `uno` / `tank`), never as a literal class string. Build a screen out
  of these rather than writing a new class string — the app previously had 856 `className`
  attributes spelling out 576 distinct strings, which is how eight different modal panels
  and three incompatible primary buttons happened.
- `engine/` must stay free of React and of side effects. Engine functions mutate or
  return state and report what happened as an `events` array; the caller turns those
  into sound, broadcasts, modals and timers. That is what keeps them unit-testable.
  - UNO: `(game, ...args) => { ok, reason?, events }`, mutating `game` in place.
  - Tank: `stepWorld(world, inputs) => { world, events }`, returning a new world.
- When a file passes ~400 lines, that is the signal to split it, not a target to beat.

## Design system

The visual language is **"Table"**: a game night table under a single lamp. Every token
lives in the `@theme` block of `src/index.css` — there is no `tailwind.config.js` and one
must not be created.

The rule that makes it hold together is that **there is exactly one light source, at the
top of the viewport, and every surface obeys it**:

- one background, `bg-table`. Never black, never a neutral grey, never a second value.
- raised things use `shadow-lift-1` / `-2` / `-3`; each carries a warm inset highlight on
  its top edge. Pressed-in things (inputs, code cells, the emoji discs) use `shadow-sink`.
- pressing an object pushes it into the table: `active:scale-[0.98] active:shadow-lift-0`.
- the lamp itself is `.table-lamp` on the app root. It does not move and does not animate.

The shell is deliberately almost colourless. **The only saturated colour in the app comes
from the three game inks** (`imposter` / `uno` / `tank`) plus the semantic `ok` / `danger`
/ `turn`. No gradients — the red-to-amber-to-emerald and cyan-to-blue buttons the three
games each had were the most generic thing in the repo.

Three typefaces, three jobs: `font-display` (Bricolage Grotesque, **one weight**) for
headings and game names, `font-sans` (Hanken Grotesk) for everything else, `font-mono`
(DM Mono) for room codes, timers, counts, HP and scores. `font-black` and `font-extrabold`
are not used. Radii are `rounded-well` / `-object` / `-slab`, and nothing else.

UNO extends the lamp rule by exactly one step, and it is the only game that extends it:
**the light over the board burns the colour of the card in play** (`.uno-table-light`,
`--live` set from `COLOR_CONFIG[...].hex`). That is why UNO's four card colours are real
tokens — `--color-card-red` / `-yellow` / `-green` / `-blue` / `-face`. They are the one
place saturated colour belongs to a game's *material* rather than its ink. Keep the hex in
`COLOR_CONFIG` in step with the token: a custom property cannot be read back as a class.

The light is never the only signal. Red/green is UNO's classic accessibility failure and
an ambient colour makes it worse, so the live colour is always also named in words beside
the discard, and every card keeps its numeral plus two corner indices.

The sub-14px range is `text-nano` (10px) / `text-micro` (11px) / `text-mini` (12px). 10px
is the floor. Do not reach for an arbitrary `text-[9px]`; there used to be 118 of those.

**Nothing in the toolchain catches an undefined Tailwind class** — `no-undef` covers JS
identifiers, not class strings, and three undefined utilities shipped that way before.
After touching styles, check the diff's new utilities against the `@theme` block by hand.

## The rule that matters most: host authority

Both networked games are **host-authoritative**. The host owns the only real game state;
clients send *intent* and render whatever the host broadcasts.

```
Client  --- intent (ACTION_* / FIRE / PLAYER_INPUT) --->  Host
Client  <-- full state snapshot (SYNC_GAME_STATE / WORLD_STATE) --- Host
```

Never let a client mutate game state locally and assume it sticks. Optimistic lobby
updates are fine — the host's next broadcast is the truth. Never trust a value a client
sent as game-affecting input without re-deriving or validating it host-side.

The host is also a player: `playerId` 0 in UNO, slot `p1` (blue) in Tank.

Host state deliberately lives in a `useRef`, not `useState`, so it is immune to stale
closures inside network callbacks and timers. Keep it that way.

## Before claiming a change works

Run `npm test` (290 tests) and `npm run lint`. The engine tests exist because the UNO
rules and the Tank collision maths are easy to break silently.

Where the coverage is:

| Module | Tests |
|---|---|
| `uno/utils/deck.js` | 43 |
| `uno/engine/hostEngine.js` | 63 |
| `uno/services/unoHandshake.js` | 20 |
| `uno/utils/unoAi.js` | 23 |
| `uno/utils/turnOrder.js` | 16 |
| `uno/utils/drawFlightGeometry.js` | 10 |
| `tank/engine/tankSimulation.js` | 53 |
| `tank/utils/tankPhysics.js` | 33 |
| `tank/utils/arenaGeometry.js` | 14 |
| `tank/utils/joystickMath.js` | 12 |
| `tank/utils/tankHud.js` | 3 |

The notable gap is `uno/hooks/useUnoAiGame.js` — solo-vs-AI holds its state in React,
so it cannot be tested without a renderer. Treat changes there as unverified and play a
solo game through.

For rules changes, the invariant to check by hand is that a UNO deck stays whole:
`sum(all hands) + drawPile + discardPile === 108` (216 with 6+ players, which uses two
decks).

For anything touching networking or controls, test on two real devices. A dev-server
tab talking to another tab on the same machine does not exercise ICE, NAT or touch
input.

## Environment

Copy `.env.example` to `.env`. Multiplayer works on most home Wi-Fi with public STUN
alone; TURN credentials (`METERED_USERNAME` / `METERED_CREDENTIAL`) are only needed for
strict NAT and mobile data. Use the non-`VITE_` names so the values stay server-side —
`VITE_`-prefixed vars are baked into the client bundle.

## Notes

`docs/` holds longer working notes (architecture, per-engine deep dives, the bug ledger,
deferred work). It is **git-ignored** and local to this machine — read it if present,
but do not assume a collaborator has it.
