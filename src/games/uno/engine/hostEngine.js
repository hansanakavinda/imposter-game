/**
 * UNO host-authoritative rules engine.
 *
 * Pure in the sense that matters: no React, no network, no audio, no timers. Every
 * function takes the mutable `game` object (see `createHostGame`), mutates it in place,
 * and returns a result describing what happened:
 *
 *   { ok: boolean, reason?: string, events: Event[] }
 *
 * `ok: false` means nothing changed and the caller should not broadcast. `ok: true`
 * means `game` was mutated and the caller should broadcast the new state and act on
 * `events` (play a sound, open a modal, start a timer).
 *
 * The game object is deliberately a plain mutable object rather than React state: the
 * host reads and writes it from network callbacks and timers, where a stale closure
 * over a useState value would silently corrupt the match.
