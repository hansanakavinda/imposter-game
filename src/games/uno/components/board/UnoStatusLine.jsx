/**
 * One line, under the table, for what is happening right now.
 *
 * This replaces four separate widgets -- a skip alert, a stack banner, an
 * action toast and a turn prompt -- that each mounted and unmounted on their
 * own, so the board visibly jumped as they came and went, and up to three of
 * them narrated the same moment in three different voices.
 *
 * The height is fixed for the same reason: an empty line holds its space
 * rather than shoving the piles around.
 *
 * Note what is deliberately *not* in the ladder: "your turn". Your seat is lit
 * and your playable cards have lifted out of your hand -- the screen has said
 * it twice already, and saying it a third time in a pulsing banner was the
 * loudest thing on the old board.
