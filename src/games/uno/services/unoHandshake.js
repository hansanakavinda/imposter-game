/**
 * UNO room admission control.
 *
 * Deciding whether an incoming peer may take a seat is the most intricate
 * non-rules logic in the game, and it is entirely separate from the rules:
 * empty-name checks, late-join refusal, matching a returning player by peer id /
 * session id / name, probing a possibly-dead connection that still holds their seat,
 * and capacity. It lives here so hostEngine stays about cards and UnoGame stays about
 * rendering.
 *
 * `admitPlayer` mutates `game.players` on the accepted paths and reports what happened;
 * the caller is responsible for the WELCOME / SYNC_GAME_STATE / ROOM_UPDATE messages,
 * which need state only it can build.
